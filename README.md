# HSIApps Informational Website

## Important highlights
1. This site is no longer live because it didn't comply with needed requirements as far as proper font usage/color scheme etc..
2. Should it wish to be brought back online and improved:  it was developed using Mobirise the free version for PC/Mac.   The source is here in github as the zip file in the root folder
3. Within the source zip there are two folders that are not part of the Mobirise source:
- unused assets - might be useful for future improvements
- additional-pages - this contains two files that need to exist in the published github repo home.  They are required to support the Play store listing.
4. To do list for improvements are here:  https://github.com/hsappsweb/hsapps-website/issues  

## website publishing process for non github experts (aka anyone can do it)
1. Using mobirise, publish locally to a local folder c:\temp
2. From https://github.com/hsappsweb/hsapps-website click Add file, and then just drag and drop the source into github.
3. If you started w/ a clean repo, don't also forget to copy the two files from the additional-pages folder into the github root / home folder

## editing the html
Mobirise is designed for non coders, no html editing is required.  Yet sometimes to do something mobirise doesn't support, you need to edit the html.  If you want to do that use the free plugin that allows it https://witsec.nl/extension-code-editor.html.  In particular I needed to edit the html to get the MV and PM icons to show up on the top block of their pages.
